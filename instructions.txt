There are three types of Exchange

1. Topic exchange
 == Here we can mention routing key or wild card as well. If no routing key matches packet won't be forwarded to any of the queues.
 == When sending events we have to mentioned exchange name along with routing key else packet will be forward to default exchange.
 == eg. if routing key is tx.event.# any routing pattern tx.event.--- can be accepted.
 == eg. if routing key is tx.event.* only tx.event.- will be accepted. Make sure when you test you delete # pattern first else you 
    will be confused that why event is accepted even though * used in routing key.
