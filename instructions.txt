There are three types of Exchange

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

1. Topic exchange
 == Here we can mention routing key or wild card as well. If no routing key matches packet won't be forwarded to any of the queues.
 == When sending events we have to mentioned exchange name along with routing key else packet will be forward to default exchange.
 == eg. if routing key is tx.event.# any routing pattern tx.event.--- can be accepted.
 == eg. if routing key is tx.event.* only tx.event.- will be accepted. Make sure when you test you delete # pattern first else you 
    will be confused that why event is accepted even though * used in routing key.
    
2. Fanout Exchange 
== No matter what routing key you provide it will send message to all listeners.

3. Header Exchange :
== Will match key which is coming in header along with value.

4. Direct Exchange :
== Exact key should be matched.


Don't forget to check queue bindings in UI if you think something is wrong with the routings. You may have to delete if you change bindings in code at debug time.
